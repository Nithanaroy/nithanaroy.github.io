Summary: Deep Learning has many parameters, hyperparameters and concepts. This article aims to give a quick refresher on some core topics, especially to those who are new to this field. Some use cases I can think of - (1) Whenever you encounter a term in Deep Learning online when surfing the web and cannot remember what it means, come here and do a quick find. (2) If you are preparing for an interview for a ML role and want to quickly revise, this is a good place as being concise and complete was my primary motto.
